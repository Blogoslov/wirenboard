libnfc ctypes bindings form RFIDiot (https://github.com/AdamLaurie/RFIDIOt/tree/master/rfidiot) are used with minor changes (storing ATQA).
TODO: move python nfc bindings to distinct repository



High-level mifare helpers are not used, all the communication to Mifare is done using raw PN53x APDUs.
